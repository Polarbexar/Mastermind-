## Description:

Jurassic Park meets Mastermind. The park is shutting down, and it's your job to stop that! 

You will need to enter the correct code before the power runs out.

* Select a cell and then click which line of code to input.
* Once all four cells are filled and you are happy with your selection, press "Execute".
* The code will then change colors as the clues.
 * Green means the code is correct and in the right spot.
 * Yellow means the code is correct but in the wrong spot.
 * Black means the code does not belong.

See if you can save the park!
